        <h1>The Suzuki GSX-8R</h1>
        <p>Is a sportbike that combines a full fairing styled by the artist’s pen and refined by the wind tunnel¹. It's
            propelled by Suzuki’s <b>new-generation</b> 776cc parallel-twin engine.</p>
        <img src="GSX-8R/1.jpg" alt>


        <h2>Engine</h2>
        <p>The GSX-8R uses Suzuki’s new parallel <b>twin engine</b>, which delivers torque in abundance across the rev range,
            provides an <b>exciting</b> character and feeling thanks to its 270-degree crankshaft design, and enables a slim
            chassis design thanks to its compact layout¹.</p>
            <img src="GSX-8R/2.jpg" alt>
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>The GSX-8R is fitted with SHOWA’s SFF-BP fork and matching shock for <b>agile</b> and sure handling.</p>
        <img src="GSX-8R/3.jpg" alt>
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>The GSX-8R has a <b>full fairing</b> styled by the artist’s pen and refined by the wind tunnel¹.</p>
        <img src="GSX-8R/4.jpg" alt>
        <h2>Transmission</h2>
        <p>The GSX-8R comes with a slick enough quickshifter and autoblipper as standard¹. This <b>standard-equipment</b>
            system lets you shift up or down without operating the clutch lever while in motion. Features include <b>clean</b>
            upshifts with <b>smooth acceleration</b> and downshifts that are also quick and easy, thanks in part to automatic
            blipping and engine braking working together⁷.</p>
            <img src="GSX-8R/5.jpg" alt>
        <h2>Electronics</h2>
        <p>Aiding rideability, usability, and flexibility is a suite of electronic systems that includes a bidirectional
            quickshifter as standard, three <b>selectable engine power</b> modes, and three <b>selectable traction control</b>
            settings, plus the ability to disengage the system entirely⁴. There’s also Suzuki’s low RPM assist and
            <b>easy-start function</b>⁴. With <b>progressive features</b> ranging from its parallel twin engine, <b>robust frame</b>,
            separately forged aluminium handlebars, uniquely shaped aluminium swingarm, inverted front forks, dual front
            disc brakes with four-piston radial-mount calipers, LED lighting and colour TFT LCD multifunction instrument
            panel, to <b>advanced electronic</b> control systems that include Suzuki <b>Drive Mode Selector</b>, Suzuki Traction
            Control System, the Bi-Directional Quick Shift system and the Ride-by-Wire Electronic Throttle System, the
            GSX- 8R is a sportbike destined to lead the way toward an exciting <b>new era of riding</b> pleasure⁵.</p>
            <img src="GSX-8R/6.jpg" alt>
        <h2>Price</h2>
        <p>As of now, the GSX-8R is available at a starting price of <b>£8,899</b>¹.</p>
        <img src="GSX-8R/7.jpg" alt>

        <p>The GSX-8R is built for comfort <b>over</b> sheer aggression². The engine is still <b>impressively usable</b>, with a meaty
            mid-range and the ability to be lazy with the gearbox². It's a motorcycle that's worthy of consideration for
            its <b>speed</b> and all its <b>glory</b>².</p>
