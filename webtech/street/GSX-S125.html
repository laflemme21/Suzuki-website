        <h1>The Suzuki GSX-S125</h1>
        <p>Is a lightweight street sport motorcycle that is both <b>easy to ride</b> and delivers <b>high
                performance</b>².

        </p><img src="GSX-S125/1.jpg" alt>
        <h2>Engine</h2>
        <p>The GSX-S125 is powered by a <b>single cylinder</b>, liquid cooled, DOHC (Double Over Head Cam) engine².
            This engine is a perfect example of how to make <b>a lot of power</b> out of a <b>very efficient</b> and
            compact power plant².
            This power combines with <b>strong torque</b> and <b>exceptional fuel economy</b>, to create an engine
            worthy of the GSX-S marque¹.

        </p><img src="GSX-S125/2.jpg" alt>
        <h2>Chassis & Components</h2>
        <p>The chassis design of the GSX-S125 is <b>light and compact</b>, giving the rider <b>ultimate control</b> on
            the streets for a fast and agile ride¹.
            For a street bike, low weight is key, this helps deliver a bike with <b>responsive and rewarding
                handling</b> as well as added confidence on the street².
            Contributing to the bike's low weight are the 10 spoke cast <b>aluminium wheels</b>¹.
            Having lightweight wheels helps ensure <b>great handling</b>, for a ride that’s fun and a machine that goes
            exactly where you want it to².

        </p><img src="GSX-S125/3.jpg" alt>
        <h2>Brakes</h2>
        <p>The GSX-S125 has the <b>latest Bosch ABS 10 base unit</b>, which is the lightest and most compact two-channel
            ABS system on the market¹.
            The sporty-looking petal-design 290mm front disc works with a dual-piston caliper and the 187mm petal-design
            rear disc works with a single-piston caliper, both delivering <b>excellent braking performance</b>¹.
        </p><img src="GSX-S125/4.jpg" alt>
        <h2>Suspension</h2>
        <p>The GSX-S125 is equipped with telescopic, coil spring, oil damped front suspension that provides a smooth and
            controlled ride. The front suspension is well-damped and <b>firm</b> enough to be competent both in town and
            out in
            the twisties. The rear features a link type, coil spring, oil damped suspension. It <b>reacts
                efficiently</b> to
            varying road surfaces to maintain an agile and stable feel. Both the front and rear suspensions contribute
            to a <b>comfortable and responsive</b> ride on various road conditions.

        </p><img src="GSX-S125/5.jpg" alt>
        <h2>Price</h2>
        <p>As of 2024, the GSX-S125 is available for <b>£4,799</b>¹.
